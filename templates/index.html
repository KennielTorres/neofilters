            <p>
                As known, Spotify offers a handful of options to filter your playlists 
                to your likings. However, at times it feels like you want to be surgical about it. 
                Here at neofilters, we are able to offer you advanced
                filtering options such as filtering by the release date, or even a range of dates, 
                popularity, amongst others.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to give you the most control over your music, because we believe that 
                nobody knows you better than yourself. We hope you enjoy this platform!
