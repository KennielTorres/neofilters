            <p>
                As known, Spotify offers a handful of options to filter and curate your playlists 
                to your likings. However, at times it feels like there aren't enough
                options. Here at spotifilters, we are able to offer you the traditional and even more advanced
                filtering options such as filtering by the release date, or even a range of dates, 
                genres, and artists, amongst many more.
            </p>

                We want to give you the most control over your music, because we believe that 
                nobody knows you better than yourself. We hope you enjoy this platform!
